### Performance

Did the network's output make sense?
How could you adjust weights or activation functions to improve accuracy?
What did you notice about how small changes (e.g., weights) affect outcomes?

The network's output did make sense, as the values chosen would indicate that
the processed data was the desired outcome (an image of a U.S. stop sign).
TODO: Additional trials

### Ethics

What potential biases or ethical considerations could arise in your example scenario?

### Reflection
